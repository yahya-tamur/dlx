Knuth's paper describing the algorithm (and giving the idea to apply it to
pentominoes).

Sudoku test file taken from //https://github.com/shadaj/sudoku
Honestly we used that test file in class using another algorithm in python
and I wanted to see how much faster this would be.

I worked on this a while ago and I decided to put it on github.
There are no tests and the main.cpp file isn't great (with a little work it
could take command line inputs).
main.cpp has some functions that do various things explained in the comments.
Without command line inputs, just call those functions in main().

make to build, make clean to remove created files, ./a.out to run
